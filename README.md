# Make Data Count - Finding References | Kaggle Competition

## Overview
Your efforts can help Make Data Count (MDC). Scientific data are critically undervalued even though they provide the basis for discoveries and innovations. We aim to improve our understanding of the links between scientific papers and the data used in those studiesâ€”what, when, and how they are mentioned. This will help to establish the value and impact of open scientific data for reuse. The current version of the MDC Data Citation Corpus is an aggregation of links between data and papers, but these links are incomplete: they only cover a fraction of the literature and do not provide context on how the data were used. The outcome of this competition is a highly performant model that will continuously run on scientific literature to automate the addition of high quality and contextualized data-to-paper connections in to the MDC Data Citation Corpus.
